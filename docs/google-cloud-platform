# Google Cloud Platform
Nok.ie uses Google Cloud Platform, also known as GCP. This requires your local environment to have GCP credentials. The easiest way to do this is with the [Google Cloud Command Line Interface](https://cloud.google.com/cli).

To install the tool, just follow [Google’s installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

Once installed, you can authenticate by initializing the tool.
```sh
gcloud init
```

When asked, select `deed-ie` as the “cloud project to use”. If you missed that step, the project can be configured afterwards with a CLI command.
```sh
gcloud config set project deed-ie
```

With the tool properly configured, you should be able to credentials for local application development.
```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```
